**Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository**

**Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.**
Navigate to the repositories tab on your GitHub profile page and click the 'new' button. Fill in your repository name and decide whether you'd like it to be public or private. Check the box to 'initialize this repository with a README'. If you'd like to designate any kind of licensing rights to your work, you can do so in the add a license tab. Click 'Create repository.' Then, on your repository page, use the widget on the bottom right to copy your repository url. Open up your terminal, change to the directory folder you'd like to house your repository, and type the command [git clone PASTE-CLONED-URL].

**Describe what open source means**
Open source is a term used to describe a program whose raw source code is available to users. Users are able and allowed to modify the program's code to improve and add functionality.

**What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like a utopia?**
Open source seems like a very powerful model, which can be utilized to keep up with diverse and constantly changing technological demands. It seems like it would work best with a sort of benevolent dictator of a moderator implementing the best changes to the 'official' copy of the program.

**Assess the importance of using licenses.**
Licenses enable content creators to protect their work in the way they see fit. Some licenses prevent any use without permission, some provide permission for use with minor conditions, and some offer completely open usage without restriction.

**What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?**
I'm still getting used to the workflow involved in pull requests and merging my branches to the master. After feeling a little lost for a bit, I was able to get a grasp on what I was doing, and I feel like I mostly just need to repeat the process some more to solidify my understanding.

**Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.**
