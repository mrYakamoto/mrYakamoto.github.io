**What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin while doing this challenge?**

Padding, borders, and margin all seem extremely important to getting a good page layout. It took me quite a lot of futzing around to get them in a good way, and I was doing a lot of checking on where unintended spacing was coming from. I feel like I need some more practice and experience to fully understand the rippling implications of each of these properties on my pages.

**What did you learn about CSS positioning?**

I learned the different uses for fixed, static, relative, and absolute. While I think I grasp the basics of each of these, I think I also need a lot more practice here to fully understand exactly when, for example, absolute should be used rather than relative. I need to do some more reseach into float to understand how other elements interpret floating elements.

**What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?**

The navigation bar and header were very straightforward and I didn't have any problems. When my design got a little outside of a rigid frame and needed more styling as far as placement on the page, I had a bit more trouble. Floating my picture and positioning my links confused me for a minute.

**What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?**

After watching one of the lecture videos on CSS, I attempted to implement the atomic style that was talked about. I'm not certain I'm using this approach totally correctly, but I found it a useful tool when it became necessary to change many elements on the page at once instead of going through one at a time. Since my page is pretty simple and broken up into easily distinguished areas, I might have been better off just styling by area instead of going the atomic route.
