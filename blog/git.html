  <h2>Version Control and git/GitHub</h2>
  <h4>10.04.2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>
      My program with DevBootcamp kicked off this week with an introduction to using the terminal, version control, and the simple functions of git/GitHub. Despite being a beginner, I found these concepts fairly easy to understand and picked up the basics without too much trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
        Version control seems like an extremely useful concept to employ while programming or really just creating anything. Put simply, version control keeps track of all progress and changes made to the product. Good version control will provide concise summations of each time work has been done. It can tell you what was done to the project, where it was done, when it was done, who did it, and why they did it. In programming, where every detail matters, version control is all but essential to track down, fix, and prevent mistakes. Once the flaw is identified, it's possible to revert the file back to before the flaw was created. If multiple people are working on the same project, whoever's mistake it was can be notified and future mistakes be prevented.
    </p>
    <p>
        Git is a version control system (VCS) that's used to maintain version control on all levels of projects. Git allows the user to save their changes whenever they see fit and provide a simple summation of their changes called a 'commit'. By writing well formatted commits, git easily allows the user to keep a log of all changes made to their files. What files were altered, when, and why. While git exists locally on the user's computer, GitHub is a remote server that users can share their code to in order to work in conjunction with other programmers. Through proper usage, a team can work on a project or even the same files simultaneously without interferring with each other's work. They can also rapidly share and collaborate on code. Even if not collaborating, GitHub can be a useful storage space on a remote server to make sure files are safe.
