    <h2 >Regular Expressions</h2>

      <p>
        <span class="fw-bold">Regular Expressions</span>, often abbreviated as <span class="fw-bold">regex</span>, are a frequently used method for defining a search pattern. They're used in many programming languages including Ruby and JavaScript. A regular expression is formed by using patterns of characters in between two forward slashes / /.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regex are commonly used in methods such as... <br><span class="fw-bold">search, replace, match, split, test, and exec.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        /a/ would relate to the first 'a' in a string, whereas /abc/ would relate to the first 'abc' all together in a string. The | character can be used as an or. For example /a|b|c/ would relate to the first 'a' or 'b' or 'c' character.
      </p>
      <p>
        brackets are a very commonly used tool of regular expressions. any single character inside brackets will be searched for. So, /[abc]/ would be the same as /a|b|c/. Brackets are also used to search for characters within a range. /[0-5]/ would relate to number characters 0 through 5. /[d-g]/ would relate to letter characters 'd' through 'g'.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regular expressions also come with 'flags' that can be powerful search tools. 'g' and 'i' are perhaps the most common. They're placed outside the forward slashes like so, /harry/g. 'g' stands for global and will relate to not just the first instance of 'harry' but all instances of it. 'i' will perform a case-insensitive search. /harry/gi will relate to not just all instances of 'harry' but 'Harry', 'hArRY', or any other combination of the same characters without regard to case.
      </p>
      <p>
        These are just some important basics with regards to regular expressions. Although it's simple to understand their basic use, their usage can become very complicated. For example...<br>^\(*\d{3}\)*( |-)*\d{3}( |-)*\d{4}$<br>Here's a thorough documentation of regular expression characters and usage
