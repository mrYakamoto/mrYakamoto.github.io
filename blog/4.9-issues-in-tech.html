        <p>When people are able bodied, it's easy to forget about people with different needs. Keeping this in mind is a huge part of tech design as not everyone is a thirty something, yoga enthusiast, living in the bay area. There are many areas of accessibility to be tackled and making a site or app accessible to everyone can be an essential factor in gaining millions of users.

          Before I looked into this topic, I thought of elderly, blind, and/or deaf people when I thought of accessibility. There are many other special needs that had not crossed my mind though. For example, justified text is apparently difficult for people with dyslexia, and being able to access a site without a mouse is important for people with limited mobility. As computers and tech become more and more quintessential vehicles of communication in the world, it's important to not have large segments of the population left out of our modern society. According to the world wide web consortium, the UN has even recognized access to information and communication technologies as a basic human right.

          Luckily, as technology advances, the ability to provide technology to people of all needs is becoming easier and easier. Speech recognition enables access to those with limited movement and can make creating transcripts for audio content almost effortless. As the first generation of humans who grew up in the age of the internet age into seniority, the demand for special needs access to technology seems like it will grow exponentially. Regardless of market share though, I would agree that making sure your site is as accessible as possible to those with special needs is just the right thing to do.
