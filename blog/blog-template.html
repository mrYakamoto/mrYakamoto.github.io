  2.7 RELEASE 2: REFLECT
  - How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
      Due to my lack of experience at designing a webpage, it was great to have a partner to bounce questions and ideas off of. I don't think there were many major issues, but we were both able to quickly answer some concerns or confusion about what's expected out of the wireframe and HTML. My pair was able to show me some shortcuts and online resources that were extremely helpful.

  - Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
      Absolutely. It doesn't take long to at least through a simple wireframe together for a site, and it provides a clear cut diagram to easily follow while writing the code for a site. It seems like it would be even more important when coding with a group, so that everyone gets a clear picture of the design and remains on the same page.

  - What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
      We decided to keep it simple and streamlined for this first wireframing project. I mostly went with basic boxes outlining what and where each section of my page will be.

  - What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
      I hadn't used many semantic elements before this section. I learned <header>, <img>, <nav>, <main>, <footer>, and <section>.
